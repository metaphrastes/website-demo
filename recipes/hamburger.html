    The best burger recipe for summertime grilling! This juicy burger is jam-packed with

        list of the ingredients needed for the recipe
    -->
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Beef: These basic burgers start with 1 ½ pounds of lean ground beef.</li>
      <li>Onion: A finely chopped onion takes the flavor up a notch.</li>
      <li>Cheese: You’ll need shredded Colby Jack or Cheddar cheese.</li>
      <li>Egg: An egg lends moisture and helps bind the patties together.</li>
      <li>Seasonings, herbs, and sauces: These hamburgers are flavored with an envelope 
        of dry onion soup mix, fresh garlic, garlic powder, soy sauce, Worcestershire 
        sauce, dried parsley, dried basil, dried oregano, crushed dried rosemary, salt, 
        and pepper.</li>
    </ul>

    <!--  
        Finally, under the ingredients list, add a “Steps” heading followed by an 
        ordered list of the steps needed for making the dish
    -->
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Combine the ingredients in a bowl.</li>
      <li>Make four patties.</li>
      <li>Grill the patties until the juices run clear and the meat is no longer pink in the center.</li>
      <li>Cooked on a grill heated to high heat; these patties should be fully cooked after about 4 to 
        5 minutes per side. You’ll know they’re done when the juices run clear, they’re no 
        longer pink in the center, and an instant-read thermometer shows at least 165 degrees F.</li>
    </ol>
