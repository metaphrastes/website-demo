    <h3>Description</h3>
    This easy apple pie was my mother's recipe. I make this simple recipe for homemade 
    pie all the time; I love it. I often add a dash of nutmeg, so you can put that in if you wish.

    <!--
        Under the description, add an “Ingredients” heading followed by an unordered 
        list of the ingredients needed for the recipe
    -->
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>1 (14.1 ounce) package pastry for a 9-inch double-crust pie</li>
      <li>¾ cup white sugar, or more to taste</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
      <li>6 cups thinly sliced apples</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon butter</li>
    </ul>

    <!--  
        Finally, under the ingredients list, add a “Steps” heading followed by an 
        ordered list of the steps needed for making the dish
    -->
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C).</li>
      <li>Line a 9-inch pie dish with one pastry crust; set second one aside.</li>
      <li>Combine 3/4 cup sugar and cinnamon in a small bowl. Add more sugar if your apples are tart.</li>
      <li>Layer apple slices in the prepared pie dish, sprinkling each layer with cinnamon-sugar mixture.</li>
      <li>Dot top layer with small pieces of butter. Cover with top crust.</li>
      <li>Bake pie on the lowest rack of the preheated oven for 10 minutes. Reduce oven temperature to 350 
        degrees F (175 degrees C) and continue baking until golden brown and filling bubbles, 30 to 35 
        minutes more.</li>
      <li>Serve warm or cold.</li>
    </ol>
